  <h2>Spherical Flocking</h2>

  <p>Based on flocking rule of Craig W. Reynolds a modified rule was designed and applied to agents to simulate behavior of group of fishes underwater. Fishes are presented in shadow, for dark silhouette to give a feeling of deep see where lights only comes from above, with water ripples shape.</p>

  <p>The scene gets rendered in full surrounding spherical viewport so that it can be projected into the inner surface of 5-meter-radius sphere, the AlloSphere at UCSB. Positions of fishes will also spatialize the sound inside the sphere, with help of the full 3-D spatial audio setup of the AlloSphere. All visual and sound are generated in realtime.</p>
