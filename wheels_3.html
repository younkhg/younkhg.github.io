        Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist uses a system, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.

        The key element in generative art is then the system to which the artist cedes partial or total subsequent control.

        First, note that the term generative art is simply a reference to how the art is made, and it makes no claims as to why the art is made this way or what its content is. Second, generative art is uncoupled from any particular technology. Generative art may or may not be "high tech". Third, a system that moves an art practice into the realm of generative art must be well defined and self-contained enough to operate autonomously.

        The phrase "complex system" has been adopted as a specific technical term. Complex systems typically have a large number of small parts or components that interact with similar nearby parts and components. These local interactions often lead to the system organizing itself without any master control or external agent being "in charge". Such systems are often referred to as being self-organizing. These self-organized systems are also dynamic systems under constant change, and short of death or destruction, they do not settle info a final stable "equilibrium" state.
