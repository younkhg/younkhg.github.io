        Nake (Chap. 3) is more skeptical about formal computer models of creativity, seeing the popular concept of creativity today as "a US-American invention," one that may be considered as a <ita>means</ita> for activity, or as its <ita>goal</ita>.

        <ita>Novelty</ita> is an integral part of the made world; and a <ita>selection</ita> process operates to choose novel artifacts for replication and addition to the stock of made things

        Today, the term 'generative art' is still current within the relevant artistic community. (...) Both in music and in visual art, the use of the term has now converged on work that has been produced by the activation of a set of rules <ita>and</ita> where the artist lets a computer system take over at least some of the decision-making (although, of course, the artist determines the rules).
        <ln>...</ln>
        The rules define the form. Think of a fugue, or of serial music. Think of perspective, or the golden section. This is the second answer to the question of why I found generative processes artistically interesting. Generative art enables the artist to concentrate on the underlying rules themselves: the structures that define the artwork, as against the surface.
        <ln>...</ln>
        In G-art, <ita>(df.) the artwork is generated, at least in part, by some process that is not under the artistâ€™s direct control</ita>.

        In making a work, the apparent freedom of the almost infinite range of possibilities is a difficulty. As, for example, Stravinsky claimed, true freedom comes with the application of constraints (Stravinsky 1942). After all, how is one to select from the infinite? This is, for example, the problem of facing the blank canvas or the clean sheet of paper. It is necessary to find a way of reducing the options to a manageable level. One way of doing this is to select a structure to which the work will conform, such as an algorithm for determining the form. In fact, the choice or design of such an algorithm is a major aesthetic decision in aesthetic decision in itself.
