        Much work is based on established, readymade systems and algorithms: particle systems, cellular automata, physical simulations, and so on. We recognise the pedagogical value of imitation, but we are concerned that these systems operate as "black boxes" whose internal operations are obscure to the artists and designers using them.

        As Galanter himself notes (and Popper before him), in the context of art, a work’s medium, its "content", and often the technology from which it is made, are all relevant in some cases, as are a host of other traits. Galanter’s mapping does not facilitate discussion about any aspects of a work apart from order and complexity. This is insufficient when describing, analysing, comparing and critiquing works of art.

        Our framework is divided into descriptions of four main components that constitute a generative art system: <ita>entities, processes, environmental interaction and sensory outcomes</ita>.

        In warning of an uncritical adoption of technological tools, Arns echoes, among others, Terry Fenton, who cautioned in 1969 that art should not become "the handmaiden of science". Fenton was responding to Jack Burnham’s enthusiasm for technological, process-based, autonomous art in the 1960s – work that shares many attributes with contemporary generative art (Burnham 1968; Fenton 1969). We agree that this warning remains valid. Generative art must do more than simply implement formal systems imported from the sciences.
