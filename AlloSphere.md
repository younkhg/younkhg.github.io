From Wikipedia [1]:

> "The AlloSphere includes a three-story cube that has been insulated extensively with sound-absorbing material, making it one of the largest echo-less chambers in the world. Within the chamber are two hemispheres of 5 meter radii, made of perforated aluminum. These are opaque and acoustically transparent."

I've been working at AlloSphere Research Group [2] from 2015 to 2018, as a graduate student researcher. I was involved in projects such as TEM/AP Visualization or Electron wavefunction visualization & sonification, and I also worked as the main developer for the codebase of the AlloSphere research group: Allolib. I worked on every part of the codebase especially the built system and stereoscopic rendering pipeline for projection mappings.
