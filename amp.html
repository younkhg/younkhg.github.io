  <h2>Amp</h2>

  <p>Digital world, especially the internet network, sometimes works as an amplifier that receives the input from the real world and sends back the amplified output to the real world.</p>

  <p>A waterdrop in real world falls into the digital world. In the digital world a impact of drop is repeatedly amplified and a drop of water at start becomes a flow of water in digital world. Then the amplified digital water is returned to the real world, as a powerful waterfall that could influence lot more to the real world compared to what it could have in the beginning as a tiny waterdrop.</p>
