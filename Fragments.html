<h1>Fragments</h1>
<p>with Jieliang(Rodger) Luo (<a href="http://rodgerluo.com">http://rodgerluo.com</a>)</p>
<p>Quoting Rodger's description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fragments is a multi-viewpoint video aiming to reformulate 2d image from 3d space and to create new approaches for future storytelling. This project provides a unique experience for the audience to observe a real-time multi-viewpoint video, which is produced by mixing three different videos using OpenGL shader functionality and a lenticular film. The rendering of each video involves capturing one common object from many different perspectives.</p>
<p>In terms of the object, the process begins with randomly taking segmentations in 3D space followed by a modified Convex Hull algorithm to create an asymmetric structure with different regions of the image (the scene) textured on each panel. Using fragmented pieces of the scene introduces a method in cubism: combining different perspectives in one view. Each fragment transforms in time with controlled parameters, providing a dynamic scene. With fragments of the scene not only changing by themselves but also by the position of the audience, this work shows tries to reveal hidden aesthetics of a scene. By stitching fragments that change over time and space, one could observe different aspects the original scene.</p>
