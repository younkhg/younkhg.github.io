# Getting Started

This is a portfolio Jekyll theme built from the ground up, using the [DevTips Starter Kit](http://devtipsstarterkit.com/) as a foundation for starting, and following closely the amazing tutorial by [Travis Neilson over at DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6jKLsxbFg4&list=PL0CB3OvPhDA_STygmp3sDenx3UpdOMk7P).

#### Quick-Start Guide

To start using this theme right away, [fork the repository](https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-jekyll-theme/fork). From there, you can rename the repository to `USERNAME.github.io`, where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username, and edit the `_config.yml` and `_settings.yml` file (in the `_data folder`) to your liking. Ensure that you have a branch named `gh-pages`. Your website should be ready immediately at `http://USERNAME.github.io`.

#### Full Installation Guide

For a full local installation of this theme, [download your own copy of the Portfolio Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/LeNPaul/portfolio-jekyll-theme/archive/gh-pages.zip) and unzip it into it's own directory. From there, open up your favorite command line tool, and enter `jekyll serve`. Your site should be up and running locally at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

#### Posts

You will find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works. If you already have a website built with Jekyll, simply copy over your posts.

#### Configuration

To change site settings, edit the `_config.yml` file found in the root of your repository and the `_settings.yml` file found in the `_data` folder. Anything under `Site Settings` can be tweaked to your liking.
