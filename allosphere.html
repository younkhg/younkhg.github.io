    <p>"The AlloSphere includes a three-story cube that has been insulated extensively with sound-absorbing material, making it one of the largest echo-less chambers in the world. Within the chamber are two hemispheres of 5 meter radii, made of perforated aluminum. These are opaque and acoustically transparent."

    <p>I've been working at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/">AlloSphere Research Group</a> from 2015 to 2018, as a graduate student researcher. I was involved in projects such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/html/research/temap.html">TEM/AP Visualization</a> or <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.allosphere.ucsb.edu/html/research/quantum.html">Electron wavefunction visualization & sonification</a>, and I also worked as the main developer for the codebase of the AlloSphere research group: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/allolib">Allolib</a>. I worked on every part of the codebase especially the built system and stereoscopic rendering pipeline for projection mappings.</p>

    <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/AlloSphere-Research-Group/AlloSystem">AlloSystem</a> is a C++ framework providing similar but different functionalities when compared to OpenFrameworks or Cinder. AlloSystem has built-in spherical projection support that can greatly faciliate creating content for the AlloSphere. Allolib is a fork of AlloSystem recently initiated, integrating higer version of OpenGL, cleaning up CMake build system with better support for Visual Studio, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">Dear ImGUI</a> integration for user GUI, and better handling of dependencies.</p>
