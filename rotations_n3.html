            In three dimensions, rotations have their axis.
            However, starting from four dimensions, it becomes complicated
            to deal with rotation only with one given axis.
            Thinking with `plane of rotation` rather than an axis
            helps dealing with rotations in higher dimensions.
            One kind of rotations are called `simple rotation`,
            having only one plane of rotation. Other higer dimensional
            rotations can have more than one planes of rotation.
            Here, as a proof of concept for simple rotation as audiovisual material,
            presented is a relatively trivial case of three dimensions (N=3).<br><br>

            So a plane can rotate a vector. Meanwhile, Two vectors define a plane,
            the term `bivector` from geometric algebra also relates to this.
            If two vectors that consist plane of rotation are rotated by other two planes,
            it has similar effect as changing the axis of rotation.
            Although, here, to modify a plane of rotation (two vectors),
            two planes (four vectors) are needed. If this relation is stacked by
            multiple layers, the result is somewhat similar to:<br><br>

            "There is a rotation that rotates axis of the rotation that rotates axis of ..."<br><br>

            Only difference is that the number of plane of rotations increase in power of 2.
            1 vector rotated by 1 plane, 1 plane rotated by 2 planes, 2 planes rotated by 4 planes, ...
